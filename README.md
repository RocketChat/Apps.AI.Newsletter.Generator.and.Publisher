# AI.Newsletter.Generator.and.Publisher

This Rocket.Chat app leverages modern open source LLMs (Mistral, Llama2, Phi, and so on) to help generate newsletters for special interest groups and/or teams operating on a Rocket.Chat server. The newsletter author should be able to supply raw content to the AI generator and have perfectly phrased and formatted newsletter generated. The app should allow for the immediate or scheduled publication of the resulting newsletter to either a team, subset of the server's user, or all of the server's users. The app should also allow for emailing those who prefers to receive the newsletter via email. Ideally the app should maintain a list of dynamically changing newsletter subscribers.
